# avius - my javascript environment development starter kit<br>
_**We’ve entered the era of JavaScript decision fatigue.**_<br><br>
Every time we start a new project, we’re overwhelmed at the selection of build tools, testing frameworks, component libraries and more.<br>

A starter kit serves a variety of purposes:
* It codifies a long list of decisions, best practices, and lessons learned.
* It protects from forgetting important details.
* It encourages consistency.
* It avoids repeating work.
* It increases quality because doing the right thing becomes automatic.
